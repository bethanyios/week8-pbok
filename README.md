## Goals
- [x] Set up an Express server and discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! <br>

## Important elements:

- [x] Include tests and set up code coverage.<br>
- [ ] We expect to see unit tests of pure functions <br>
- [x] Integration tests of your server routes, including tests for errors such as 404.<br>
- [x] You should write tests for your database and use a separate test database and build script<br>
- [x] Use Heroku to host the app and the database<br>
- [x] Include ES6 syntax on the server

    - Modularize our code (a bit...)
